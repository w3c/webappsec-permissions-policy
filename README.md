# Permissions Policy (previously named Feature Policy)

A web platform API which gives a website the ability to allow and deny the use of browser features in its own frame, and in iframes that it embeds. Examples of [features](https://github.com/w3c/webappsec-permissions-policy/blob/master/features.md) that could be controlled by permissions policy include:

- getUserMedia (Camera, Microphone, and Speaker-selection)
- Fullscreen
- Geolocation
- MIDI
- Payments
- Synchronous XHR
- ...
