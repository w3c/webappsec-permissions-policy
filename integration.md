# Defining Policy-Controlled Features

This guide is for authors of other standards who want to use Permissions Policy
as a mechanism for enabling and disabling their features. It's a collection of
principles and guidelines (more than actual rules) for coming up with sensible
defaults, whether the feature in question is a long standing feature on the
web, or something brand new.

## Referencing the Permissions Policy spec

There is no central registry for policy-controlled features. Feature authors who
wish to allow Permissions Policy to control their features on the web can do so
by referencing the Permissions Policy specification.

The following example shows how a feature could be declared as a
policy-controlled feature:

> Example:
>
>### Section N: Permissions Policy Integration
> The Sample API defines a [*policy-controlled feature*](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/#policy-controlled-feature)
> identified by the string "`sample`". Its [default allowlist](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/#default-allowlist)
> is `'self'` \[[PERMISSIONS-POLICY](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/)\].

The specification can then refer to this feature, and test whether it is enabled
or not in a specific document, with text similar to this:

> Example:
>
> If [this](https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#this)'s [relevant global object](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#concept-relevant-global)'s [associated Document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#concept-document-window)
> is not [allowed to use](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#allowed-to-use)
> the `sample` feature, then throw a `SecurityError`
> [DOMException](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-DOMException) and abort these steps.

(This is an example only. The actual behavior of any algorithm when a
policy-controlled feature is disabled is left up to the specification which
defines that feature.)

## Choosing a default allowlist

As described in the
[spec](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-permissions-policy/#default-allowlists), the default
allowlist chosen affects how the feature behaves when there are no declared
policies present. As a rough guide:

* Features which have already been widely available on the web platform, but
which Permissions Policy can now disable selectively, should use `*`. This
ensures that the majority of documents on the web, as well as documents which
are framed without their knowledge, will continue to behave as expected by
their original authors.
* New powerful features are often specified such that they are available in
top-level browsing contexts only, and are not available in cross-origin child
frames, for security. These kinds of features should use a default allowlist of
`'self'` to provide this behaviour. In this case, Permissions Policy also grants
site authors the ability to selectively enable the feature in other origins,
but the default behaviour is to disable it.

## Considerations for behavior when disallowed

It is important for feature authors to carefully consider the mechanism by
which their feature is disabled when disallowed in a document, for ease of
developer feature detection, as well as for compatibility with existing web
content.

Existing web platform features which already have some mechanism for reporting
errors, or signalling that the user chose not to grant permission, should use
those existing mechanisms when disabled.

New features should attempt to fail in a way which allows authors to detect
that the feature is disabled.

> Example:
>
> The fullscreen API has existed on the web for some time, and is being
> implemented as a policy-controlled feature. Developers have always had to
> contend with the fact that fullscreen may not be allowed, and the API has a
> method of signalling that.
>
> As a policy-controlled feature, the fullscreen API can specify that when
> disabled, `document.fullscreenEnabled` must return `false`, and
> `Element.requestFullscreen()` must fire a `fullscreenerror` event, and return
> a promise which rejects with a `TypeError` exception.

If an existing feature has no mechanism for reporting failure, or has never been
allowed to fail in the past, then it may be dangerous to turn it into a
policy-controlled feature, where it may start to fail on pages that were always
able to assume that it would not.

In this case, features may be better defined using [Document Policy](https://wicg.github.io/document-policy/),
as that mechanism requires an explicit opt-in by any embedded document for which
that policy is required.

> Example:
>
> The `document.write` API has existed on the web since roughly the dawn of
> JavaScript, and has no failure modes.
>
> One means of disallowing this feature via Permissions Policy would be to declare that
> any calls to `document.write()` will silently fail. However, this would mean that
> if a page contained a script like this:
>
>     <html>
>       <head>
>         <script>document.write('<script src="important-security-feature.js"></scr'+'ipt>')</script>
>         ...
>
> then an attacker could embed that page in a frame with the `document.write`
> feature disabled, and bypass the critical security script.
>
> To avoid this, a better way to disable it would be to define the availability of
> `document.write()` as a configuration point using document policy. Then the use of
> `document.write()` in a document which disables it can fire a `SecurityError`
> exception on the `document` object. If a document which is to be embedded in a frame
> which requires the policy does not conform to that required policy, it is simply not
> loaded. (See the document policy explainer and spec for details).
