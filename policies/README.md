Policy proposals
================

This directory holds a collection of non-normative proposals for
policy-controlled features. They're all written explainer-style, rather than
being specs in their own right.

These should be taken as "ideas people are considering building out", and
comments on all are wholeheartedly encouraged.

Nothing in this directory should be construed as having any kind of effect on
the core Feature Policy specification. Features here, whether implemented or
not, should be built on top of that framework.
