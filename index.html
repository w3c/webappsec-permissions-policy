    <p>This specification defines a mechanism that allows developers to
    selectively enable and disable use of various browser features and
    APIs.</p>

    <p>This is a <strong>work in progress</strong> and may change without any

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The web-platform provides an ever-expanding set of features and APIs,
    offering richer functionality, better developer ergonomics, and improved
    performance. However, a missing piece is the ability for the developer to
    selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these
    browser features and APIs within their application:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The developer may want to selectively _disable_ access to certain
      browser features and APIs to "lock down" their application, as a security
      or performance precaution, to prevent own and third-party content
      executing within their application from introducing unwanted or
      unexpected behaviors within their application.</li>
      <li>The developer may want to selectively _enable_ access to certain
      browser features and APIs which may be disabled by default - e.g. some
      features may be disabled by default in embedded context unless explicitly
      enabled; some features may be subject to other policy requirements.</li>
      <li>The developer may want to use the policy to assert a promise to a
      client or an embedder about the use—or lack of thereof—of certain
      features and APIs. For example, to enable certain types of "fast path"
      optimizations in the browser, or to assert a promise about conformance
      with some requirements set by other embedders - e.g. various social
      networks, search engines, and so on.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This specification defines a feature policy mechanism that addresses the
    above use cases.</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <div class="example">
        <p>SecureCorp Inc. wants to disable use of WebRTC and Geolocation APIs
        within their application. It can do so by delivering the following HTTP
        response header to define a feature policy:</p>
        <pre><a>Feature-Policy</a>: {"<a data-lt=
        "disable member">disable</a>":["<a>webrtc</a>","<a>geolocation</a>"]}</pre>
        <p>Unless specified otherwise, the default <a>target</a> is "`\*`",
        which means that the specified features will be disabled for all
        browsing contexts regardless of their origin.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <p>SecureCorp Inc. wants to disable use of Geolocation API within all
        browsing contexts whose origin is "`https://example.com`". It can do so
        by delivering the following HTTP response header to define a feature
        policy:</p>
        <pre><a>Feature-Policy</a>: {"<a data-lt=
        "disable member">disable</a>":["<a>geolocation</a>"], "<a data-lt=
        "target member">target</a>":["https://example.com"]}</pre>
        <p>The <a>target</a> is a list of one or more origins, which can
        include the applications origin and any third-party origin.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <p>SecureCorp Inc. is hosting an application on "`https://example.com`"
        and wants to disable WebRTC on its origin but enable it for a
        whitelisted embedee ("`https://other.com`"). It can do so by delivering
        the following HTTP response header to define a feature policy:</p>
        <pre><a>Feature-Policy</a>: {"<a data-lt=
        "disable member">disable</a>":["<a>webrtc</a>"], "<a data-lt=
        "target member">target</a>":["https://example.com"]},
        {"<a data-lt=
"enable member">enable</a>":["<a>webrtc</a>"], "<a data-lt="target member">target</a>":["https://other.com"]}</pre>
        <p>Some features are disabled by default in embedded contexts. The
        enable policy allows the application to selectively enable such
        features for whitelisted origins.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <p>FastCorp Inc. wants to disable use of synchronous `script` elements,
        synchronous `XMLHttpRequest`'s and use of `document.write` within their
        application. It can do so by delivering the following HTTP response
        header to define a feature policy:</p>
        <pre><a>Feature-Policy</a>: {"<a data-lt=
        "disable member">disable</a>":["<a>sync-xhr</a>","<a>sync-script</a>","<a>docwrite</a>"]}</pre>
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Other and related mechanisms</h2>
      <p>[[HTML5]] defines a [sandbox attribute] for `iframe` elements that
      allows developers to reduce the risk of including potentially untrusted
      content by imposing restrictions on content's abilities - e.g. prevent it
      from submitting forms, running scripts and plugins, and more. The
      [sandbox directive] defined by [[CSP2]] extends this capability to any
      resource, framed or not, to ask for the same set of restrictions - e.g.
      via an HTTP response header (`Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`). These
      mechanisms enable the developer to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set and customize a sandbox policy on any resource via CSP.</li>
        <li>Set and customize individual sandbox policies on each `iframe`
        element within their application.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, there are several limitations to the above mechanism: the
      developer cannot automatically apply a policy across all contexts, which
      makes it hard or impossible to enforce consistently in some cases (e.g.
      due to third-party content injecting frames, which the developer does not
      control); there is no mechanism to selectively enable features that may
      be off by default; the sandbox mechanism uses a whitelist approach which
      is impossible to extend without compatibility risk.</p>
      <p>Feature Policy is intended to be used in combination with the sandbox
      mechanism (i.e. it does not duplicate feature controls already covered by
      sandbox), and provides an extensible mechanism that addresses the above
      limitations.</p>

    <h2>Framework</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Policies</h2>
      <p>A <dfn>feature policy</dfn> may be applied to a [Window] or
      [WorkerGlobalScope] and consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A set of <a data-lt="directive">directives</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Directives</h2>
      <p>Each <dfn>directive</dfn> is a tuple consisting of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A <dfn>target</dfn> set by the <var>target member</var>.</li>
        <li>A <dfn>disable</dfn> list set by the <var>disable
        member</var>.</li>
        <li>A <dfn>enable</dfn> list set by the <var>enable member</var>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following sections define the set of known members in each JSON
      object describing the policy. Future versions of this document may define
      additional such members and user agents MUST ignore unknown members when
      parsing the object.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>The <var>target member</var></h2>
        <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>target member</dfn> defines the scope in which the
        directive is enforced. The member's name is "`target`" and the
        recognized values are either an array of serialized origins which may
        contain the "`self`" keyword that refers to current global's origin, or
        the string "`\*`". If an unknown value is specified, or if no member
        named "`target`" is present in the object, the <a>directive</a>'s
        <a>target</a> will be set to "`\*`".</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The <var>disable member</var></h2>
        <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>disable member</dfn> defines the <a>disable
        policy</a> for the directive. The member's name is "`disable`" and the
        value is a list of ASCII strings.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The <var>enable member</var></h2>
        <p>The OPTIONAL <dfn>enable member</dfn> defines the <a>enable
        policy</a> for the directive. The member's name is "`enable`" and the
        value is a list of ASCII strings. [response]</p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>`Feature-Policy` HTTP Header Field</h2>
        <p>The <dfn>Feature-Policy</dfn> HTTP header field can be used both in
        the [response] (server to client) and a [request] (client to server) to
        communicate the <a>feature policy</a>. In the former case, the server
        is communicating the desired policy that should be enforced by the
        client, and in the latter, the client is communicating the policy that
        it will enforce.</p>
        <p>The header's value is represented by the following ABNF
        [[!RFC5234]]:</p>
        <pre class="abnf">
          Disable = 1#json-field-value
                    ; See Section 2 of [[HTTP-JFV]], and Section 2 of [[RFC7159]]
        </pre>
        <p>When the user agent receives a `Feature-Policy` header field, it
        MUST <a href="#process-response-policy">process</a> and <a>enforce</a>
        the serialized policy as described in <a href=
        "#integration-with-html"></a>. When the user agent [performs a
        fetch][fetching algorithm], it MUST advertise the active <a>feature
        policy</a> as described in <a href="#integration-with-fetch"></a>.</p>
        <h2>Process response policy</h2>
        <p>Given a [response] (<var>response</var>) and [global object]
        (<var>global</var>), this algorithm returns a <a>feature
        policy</a>.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Abort these steps if the <var>response</var>’s [header list] does
          not contain a [header] whose [name] is "`Feature-Policy`".</li>
          <li>Let <var>header</var> be the [value] of the [header] in
          <var>response</var>’s [header list] whose name is
          "`Feature-Policy`".</li>
          <li>Let <var>feature policy</var> be the result of executing
            <a href="#parse-policy-from-value-and-global"></a> on
            <var>header</var> and <var>global</var>.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>The `meta` element</h2>
        <p>A [Document] may deliver a policy via one or more HTML [meta]
        elements whose [http-equiv] attributes are an [ASCII case-insensitive]
        match for the string "`Feature-Policy`". For example:</p>
        <pre class="example nolinks">
&lt;meta http-equiv="Feature-Policy"
  content='{"disable": ["webrtc"]},
           {"enable":["geolocation"],"target":["https://example.com"}'&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>The `meta` policy is processed as defined in <a href=
        "#process-meta-policy"></a> and modifications to the
        [content][meta-content] attribute of a `meta` element after the element
        has been parsed MUST be ignored.</p>
        <p class="issue">TODO: talk about effect of multiple policies</p>
        <section>
          <h2>Process meta policy</h2>
          <p class="note">This section extends HTML's `meta` [pragma
          directives].</p><strong>Feature policy state
          (http-equiv="feature-policy")</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>If the `meta` element is not a child of a `head` element, abort
            these steps.</li>
            <li>If the `meta` element is preceded by `link`, `script` or

            <li>If the `meta` element has no [content][meta-content] attribute,
            or if that attribute's value is the empty string, then abort these
            steps.</li>
            <li>Let <var>policy</var> be the result of executing <a href=
            "#parse-policy-from-value-and-global"></a> on the `meta` element's

      <section>
        <h2>[Feature]</h2>
        <p>If the <dfn>[Feature]</dfn> [extended attribute] appears on an
        interface, partial interface, or an individual interface member, it
        indicates that the interface or interface member is subject to
        <a>feature policy</a> associated with the ECMAScript global
        environment's global object.</p>
        <p>The <a>[Feature]</a> [extended attribute] must [take an identifier],
        which must be a [global name].</p>
        <p>Whether a construct that the <a>[Feature]</a> [extended attribute]
        can be specified on is <dfn>enabled by feature policy for global</dfn>
        is defined as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the <a>[Feature]</a> [extended attribute] is specified on the
          construct, then it is <a>enabled by feature policy for global</a> if
          the "<a href="#is-feature-disabled">is feature disabled for
          global?</a>" algorithm returns "`Enabled`" when executed upon the
          extended attribute's argument and the ECMAScript global environment's
          global object.
          </li>
          <li>Otherwise, if the <a>[Feature]</a> [extended attribute] does not
          appear on a construct, then it is <a>enabled by feature policy for
          global</a>, depending on the type of construct:
            <ol>
              <li>**Interface**: the interface or dictionary is implicity
              "`Enabled`" by feature policy.</li>
              <li>**Partial interface**: the partial interface is <a>enabled by
              feature policy for global</a> if and only if the original
              interface definition is.
              </li>
              <li>**Interface member**: the interface member is <a>enabled by
              feature policy for global</a> if and only if the interface or
              partial interface the member is declared on is.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note">Whether a construct is <a>enabled by feature policy for
        global</a> influences whether it is [exposed] in a given ECMAScript
